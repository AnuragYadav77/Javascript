// console.log("hello");

// JS is a dynamically typed language i.e. we don't need to specify datatype of variable while declaring it. It automatically figures out datatype based on value assigned to it.

let x=10; //number(we didn't specify that x is number, JS automatically figured it out)
x="asdf";// now x is string
